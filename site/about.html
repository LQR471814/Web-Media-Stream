    <p class="center">"Not gonna lie I made this cause of Zoom."</p>
    <p class="center">
      I didn't have a camera or a microphone connected to my computer but I did
      have a camera and microphone in my laptop, sadly my laptop was laggy and I
      couldn't screen share anything. So I had the idea to stream the input from
      my laptop to my computer then use my computer to forward it to Zoom. For
      anyone wishing to do this you simply use OBS's (Open Broadcasting
      Software) virtual camera function to record the viewer only, then setup
      Voicemeeter Banana and use it's virtual audio CABLE to route audio from
      the viewer to zoom.
